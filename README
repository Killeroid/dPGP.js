This is a less then complete read me. This software is fairly difficult to set up at the moment, but everything one needs to do so is here.

Dependancies:
	Python 2.6 or later
		http://www.python.org/
	PycURL
		http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/
	MySQL 5.1 or later
		http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
	MySQL for Python (good luck)
		http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python
	Tornado Web Sever
		http://www.tornadoweb.org/

Instructions:
	Execute schema.sql on MySQL server.
	Modify db.py to reflect MySQL server settings (port- and socket-based connections work)
	Run "sudo python dpgp.py"
	Visit http://localhost:80/admin to get started
